Very warm welcome to first part of my series blog posts. In previous blog post, we discussed about concept of the linear regression and its mathematical model representation.  We also tried to implement linear regression in R step by step. In this post I will discuss about the logistic regression  and how to implement the logistic regression in R step by step. I hope that readers will love to read this. Again, very much thank to AndrewNG for fabulous explanation of the concept of logistic regression in coursera Machine Learning Class.
